  management_account_id = var.management_account_id
  organization_id       = var.organization_id
  region                = var.region

  # Display name for the organization in CCE
  organization_display_name = var.organization_display_name

  # IAM role configuration for scanning
  scan_organization_role_arn     = var.scan_organization_role_arn
