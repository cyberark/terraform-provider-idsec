page_title: "idsec Terraform Provider"
description: |-
  A Terraform provider for CyberArk that enables consistent, automated, and scalable identity security across your organization.
---

## Motivation

By enabling teams to define and automate CyberArk configurations as Infrastructure as Code (IaC), the *idsec* Terraform provider delivers consistent security, reduces operational risk, and accelerates deployment speed across all cloud and on-premises environments.

This solution ensures that identity and access controls scale securely alongside your critical infrastructure, maintaining full auditability and least-privilege control at every step.

## Get started

For requirements and setup information, see the relevant [Terraform provider documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install).

### Supported Terraform versions

The Terraform public registry–based provider requires **Terraform 0.13.x** or later.

## Coverage

The *idsec* Terraform provider centralizes the automation of identity security across key CyberArk solutions, ensuring comprehensive governance:

| Service | Supported operations |
|--------|----------------------|
| *Connector Management* | Standardize and deploy key components for connecting to target systems |
| *CyberArk Identity* | Manage user provisioning, roles, and access policies for workforce identities |
| *Privilege Cloud* | Automate onboarding and policy management of privileged accounts and access |
| *Secure Cloud Access* | Automate dynamic access and permissions for cloud environments |
| *Secure Infrastructure Access* | Extend least-privilege control to internal, developer-facing infrastructure |
| *Access Control Policies* | Manage access policies for cloud services, databases, and virutal machines |

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    idsec = {
      source  = "cyberark/idsec"
      version = ">= 0.1"
    }
  }
}

provider "idsec" {
  auth_method = "identity"
  username    = var.idsec_username
  secret      = var.idsec_secret
}

resource "idsec_cmgr_network" "example_network" {
  name = "example_network"
}

resource "idsec_cmgr_pool" "example_pool" {
  name                 = "example_pool"
  description          = "A pool for example resources"
  assigned_network_ids = [idsec_cmgr_network.example_network.network_id]
}

resource "idsec_sia_access_connector" "example_connector" {
  connector_type    = "ON-PREMISE"
  connector_os      = "linux"
  connector_pool_id = idsec_cmgr_pool.example_pool.pool_id
  target_machine    = "1.1.1.1"
  username          = "ec2-user"
  private_key_path  = "~/.ssh/key.pem"
}
